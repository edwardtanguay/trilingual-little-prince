My language tandem partner and I are reading the Little Prince in French, Spanish and Italian. The goal of this site is to enable me to take interactive linguistic notes based on the texts.

This site is also a way to experiment with easy-peasy Redux in a realistic site, a state management solution for React I can recommend.
